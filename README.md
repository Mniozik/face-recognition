# Face Recognition
## Description
This project contains `Python` programs designed to detect and recognize faces from images using the `OpenCV` and `NumPy` library.

* `face_train.py` - trains a face recognizer model, using algorithms such as LBPH, Eigenfaces, or Fisherfaces.
* `face_detect.py` - extracts faces from input images.
* `face_recognition.py` - recognizes extracted faces from images.
---
* `classroom_recognition.py` - the primary program of this project. It allows users to define groups of students. Based on this and input photos, the program checks the attendance of students who attended the classes. The output provides information about recognized people. In situations where the confidence level of recognition is below the threshold, the teacher should individually verify those results.
